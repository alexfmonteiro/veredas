# ADR-006: Multi-Provider Free Tier over Single Cloud

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project needs hosting for the API (Railway), frontend (Vercel), object
storage (Cloudflare R2), relational database (Neon Postgres), and caching
(Upstash Redis). We could consolidate onto a single cloud provider (AWS or
GCP) or use best-of-breed free tiers from multiple providers.

Single cloud (AWS) estimated cost: ~$40-65/month. Single cloud (GCP):
~$30-50/month. Multi-provider free tiers: under $15/month.

## Decision
Use multi-provider free tiers for v1. Each provider was chosen for its
generous free tier. All infrastructure is managed in Terraform from day one,
making future consolidation a configuration change rather than a rewrite.

## Consequences
- Total running cost under $15/month — sustainable for a portfolio project
- Each service is best-in-class for its function (Railway for containers,
  R2 for object storage with zero egress, Neon for serverless Postgres)
- More providers to manage — more dashboards, more credentials, more
  potential points of failure
- Terraform abstraction means migration to AWS/GCP is a provider swap,
  not an architecture change
- Revisit when monthly revenue exceeds the cost delta (~$30-50/month)
